a) What are some pros and cons of Agile development (vs non-Agile)? List 2 of each. 

The pros of Agile development are as follows:
1. Agile development allows for easy collaboration within a team.
2. It allows teams to be more resilient to scope changes in the project.

The cons of Agile development are as follows:
1. Agile development leads to increased overheadh because the amount of time spent planning, coordinating, and communicating via agile frameworks can cause trouble for teams with tigher deadlines or smaller teams.
2. Agile methodology places an emphasis on self-organization and communication, and this process would be severely hindered if the team dynamics do not match the necessary requirements.

The pros of non-Agile development are as follows:
1. There is more detailed documentation in non-Agile development
2. The sequential nature of Waterfall makes it easier to manage and control projects. 

The cons of non-Agile development are as follows:
1. The project would not be able to adapt to scope changes unlike in agile methodology.
2. There is little room for customer feedback before deployment since it is not necessarily an iterative process.
